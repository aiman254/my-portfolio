    <pre><b>Hello! I'm Aiman Fatima.</b>
       <h4> I was born on October 15, 2005, and I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in the 3rd semester.

        My passion for design, drawing, and creating things fuels my interest in technology and creativity.

        I enjoy learning new skills, especially programming languages like html and css, and
         I aim to become a software engineer.

        Outside of academics, I love singing and have a special place in my heart for Urdu, as I enjoy watching Pakistani serials.

        I'm focused on building my career and improving my skills, both in tech and communication.

        You can reach me via email at aimanfatima07860@gmail.com.

        My phone number is 8188802743.

        I’m currently living in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
